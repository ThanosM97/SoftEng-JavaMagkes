## Products
Each of the above directories contains products for fifteen (15) different types of electronic devices <br> 
crawled from the website of the 'directory's name' store. <br><br>
For each type there is one directory named photos-'type of device', one csv file (products-'type of device'.csv) <br>
and one xlsx file (products-'type of device'.xlsx). <br>
*In order to open the csv file use coding: UTF-8 and delimeter: '@'<br>
*The name of each image is the name of the product it pictures from the <br>
csv (or xlsx) file. In some cases the character '/' was replaced with the character '-'.<br><br>
